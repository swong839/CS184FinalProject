        <p>This will be an interactable game made in OpenGL that will focus on simulating fireworks. A user will be able to modify parameters to affect how fireworks' explosions look, ranging from the color to brightness to visibility. This will be done by implementing custom particles and particle effects system using OpenGL.</p>

    <h2 align="middle">Problem Description</h2>
        <p>First, we wanted to create an explosion simulator, but decided that was too strict of a  goal. We switched to fireworks because of the mass variety that can be simulated. There are a multitude of different types of fireworks and each one reacts differently upon detonation. The problem we will be solving is how to realistically simulate how a firework would explode and act in the physical world. We will be attempting to boil down a firework to a set of defined parameters, that can be changed to result in different explosive reactions.</p>

    <h2 align="middle">Goals and Deliverables</h2>
        <p>We will be creating an interactive demo in which you will be watching a continuous stream of fireworks launched into the dark sky. There will be a list of fields on the side of the screen that can be manipulated by you. These fields will change how the fireworks act in the scene.</p>

        <div align="center">
            <table style="width=100%">
                <tr>
                    <td align="middle">
                    <img src="Fireworks.jpg" width="480px" />
                    <figcaption align="middle">Example fireworks</figcaption>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </div>

        <p>Our goal is to create particle effects that will be able to simulate the different stages of a firework: initial launch, explosion, and aftereffects. The initial launch will include the smoke coming from the fuse. The explosion will contain all of the inital reactions and light coming from the firework. The aftereffects are the various potential ways that the light and reactions fade away after the explosion. This will include the light fading away while falling down or the lights moving in different directions.</p>

        <p>The demo will provide the user the ability to select different parameters that will generate different fireworks that produce different visual results. This will try to be as accurate as possible to real firework making. If time allows, we would like to allow users to provide an image that will determine the shape that the fireworks will explode into the shape of.</p>

        <p>We plan to create a fireworks simulator that will be able to be visually modified based on the user input. Our end results will be different images or videos of fireworks that are produced from the program. We hope to be able to incorporate some aspects of fireworks that are a bit more complicated including restricting explosion area.</p>

    <h2 align="middle">Schedule</h2>
        <p>Week 1: Research into and create vision for types of particles that we would like to have and how best to approach it. Work on OpenGL tutorials and particle effects functions </p>
        <p>Week 2: Begin work on implementing particle system</p>
        <p>Week 3: Complete particle system and implement parameter modification as well as user interface for the program </p>
        <p>Week 4: Completed project, firework and particle system are in place and they can be modified to produce different observable fireworks. </p>
